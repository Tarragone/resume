        <h1>Resume</h1>
        <p>Looking for a new job as my current employer isn't giving me enough hours and has issues with scheduling.</p>
        <h2>Previous Jobs</h2>
        <h3> Two Jacks</h3>
        <p>Worked mainly in customer service, answering phone calls and working the till. Also made dough, topped pizzas, and cut pizzas. Worked opening and closing shifts. Worked for 4 months.</p>
        <h3>Marcos Pizza - current job</h3>
        <p>Worked mostly on making pizzas for the first 3 months. Promoted to trainer at the start of November, over several candidates who had worked there longer then I had and were older. Currently working as a trainer/shift leader in training, where I welcome new employees, get them adjusted to the workplace, help them figure out the electronic system and the culture of the store, as well as how to do their jobs. I've managed interpersonal problems and relationships to maintain a healthy work environment for employees. I've been acting similar to a shift lead since December, but officially without the title for legal reasons. I've been promised an immediate promotion to shift lead as soon as I turn 18.
Worked opening and closing shifts, on each day of the week. Quick to take shifts from co-workers who needed them taken.
